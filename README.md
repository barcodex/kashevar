# kashevar

Kashevar is a generator for web apps built on top of Kasha framework.

It provides basic scaffolding on the same principles as Rails or Symfony.
It is far from being on the same level of feature completeness, but it does what it is made for.

Even though it builds Kasha apps, it is not dependent on Kasha framework, the only dependencies you will find in composer.json, is PhpUnit to run tests.

## What's the strange name?

'Kasha' means 'porridge' in Russian. The person who prepares a porridge, is called 'kashevar'.

So, suddenly it is quite logical when kashevar prepares some kasha.
