# kashevar

Kashevar is a generator for web apps built on top of Kasha framework.

It provides basic scaffolding on the same principles as Rails or Symfony.

Even though it builts Kasha apps, it is not dependent on Kasha framework, the only dependencies you will find in composer.json, is PhpUnit to run tests.
